            Hi! I'm Zach, a full-stack developer and CTF player.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated from Carnegie Mellon in 2019 and helped start a computer vision company called Zensors.
            Additionally, I solve web and reverse engineering challenges with <a href="https://pwning.net/">PPP</a> on a regular basis,
                as well as design problems for others to play.
            I'm involved in entrepreneurship, security, and mentorship and love to help out where I can.
          </p>
